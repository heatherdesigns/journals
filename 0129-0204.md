January 29 - February 4, 2017
=============================

Over the weekend: 
-----------------
January 28-29
* Created my first symlink.
* Created a dotfiles repo.

Monday:
-------
January 30
* Paired with Mike. Asked the difference between git remote and git clone.
* Finished Code School, Git Real, part 2, Levels 4, 5 & 6
* Treehouse GitHub Basics track: Get Involved in Open Source - Introduction.
* Practiced, experimented and played around in Git today. I cloned a GDI repo that was used in their Git workshop last fall. I thought it was a good place to start as I didn‚Äôt think I could hurt anything. üòÑ I added an image and edited the readme file. I kept getting error messages when I would push the repository. I tried to troubleshoot, without success. I will ask someone about it tomorrow. Moving along (my brain was starting to get fuzzy about this time), I decided to clone the apprenticeship repository that I had forked to my personal github account from Sparkbox‚Äôs github account. I made changes, pushed them up to my repository and created a pull request. BOOM!!!

Tuesday:
--------
January 31
* Arrived at work excited to start the day. I used the command line to remove the GDI repo that was giving me error messages yesterday. After pairing with Mike, I figured out what why I was getting an error message. Yay!!!
* I‚Äôve been journaling my tasks in Google docs. I‚Äôm a task list kind of girl. Lists help keep me organized and well‚Ä¶.. on task. I was debating on whether or not to share my journals on github. I thought, it‚Äôs just a list. Would anyone benefit from viewing my task list? Reflecting upon that question I decided yes, perhaps there is someone somewhere that could benefit from it. So why not!! I decided to see how previous apprentices shared their journals on github. I could simply export my Google docs into PDFs or‚Ä¶... I could create markdown files. I‚Äôve never worked with markdown files, so I decided let‚Äôs do that! After finding a fantastic markdown cheat sheet curtesy of GitHub, I created my first set of files and then worked through the process of creating a repo for my journal entries.
* Lesson #563 (jk!) for the day: Before creating my first markdown files, I should have reviewed the Sparkbox standards. On the plus side, I had the opportunity to edit my markdown files and push them back up to github. On a side note, it appears that perhaps the standards for styling markdown have not been updated in quite a while, sparking an interesting conversion on slack on whether the current standards reflect what most developers are actually doing.  
* Submitted my second pull request!!

Wednesday:
----------
February 1
Paired with Mike & Daniel to talk about classes, objects and messages using Ruby
Finished Code School‚Äôs Try Ruby track

February 2
* Reviewed GDI‚Äôs Intro to Ruby slides from classes 3 & 4. This is where oop was covered. http://kcjonesevans.com/gdidayton-intro-ruby/class4.html#/3/3
* Started Ruby Koans and only made it through 5 of 282. It‚Äôs above my skill set at the moment, or I‚Äôm just not ‚Äògetting‚Äô it. So, I ventured off to Learn Ruby the Hard Way and made great progress! I love how it really focuses on building muscle memory.    
* Went to AAF Dayton luncheon meeting. Kevin Lily, Senior VP Participation Strategy Director at Leo Burnett, will be presenting ‚ÄúWhat makes great content social and shareable, and how it can get people to act‚Äù.
