* Continued reading of Getting Real.
* Favorite phrases thus far: 
	* Don‚Äôt expect to get it right the first time.  
	* Ask people what they don‚Äôt want. (Yes! I love this! Even if people don't know exactly what they want, they usually can communicate what they don't want or don't like. It helps to open the conversation.)
	* Do the best job you can with the root of the problem then step aside. 
	* It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúFight Club.‚Äù You should only consider features if they‚Äôre willing to stand on the porch for three days waiting to be let in. (hahahaha!!!!)
	* As long as you keep people in the loop, and are honest about the situation, they‚Äôll understand. (truth!)
	* Don‚Äôt waste time on problems you don‚Äôt have yet. (I need this on a mug.)
* Read 40 Terminal Tips and Tricks You Never Thought You Needed.
* Started Code School with Try Git.

##Goals / Follow - up:
* Finish reading Getting Real.
* Reread Zero to Hero with dot files. 
* Stalk other people‚Äôs github accounts and check out their dotfiles.
* Make my first dot file. Alias idea: create an alias to go directly to the Apprenticeship outline on github???
* Reach out to 3 people to discuss the command line and dot files. Rob Tarr ‚Üí answered command line questions.
* Continue Code School with Git Real. Check out Treehouse Git course for reinforcement / review.
* Finish Console Foundations track in Treehouse.
* For fun: go check out Java bouncy ball program.
