Thursday:
---------
February 16
* Started my morning reading The Passionate Programmer.
* Code School Ruby
* Spent my afternoon rewriting hotdog_adventure.rb with hashes. I also added while statements to validate user input. I can see where writing functions that can be accessed to validate input would be useful. Perhaps this will be one of my next steps. I can also see where each topping could be segregated into separate functions or maybe even classes.  

Friday:
-------
February 17
* As I was rewriting hotdog_adventure.rb on Thursday, as part of the validation of user input I really wanted to be able to return the user‚Äôs answer to them if it was wrong. On my drive home that afternoon the light bulb in my brain went off! I had an idea I wanted to try. Friday morning arrived and I went to work. I updated the code validating the user‚Äôs input. After speaking with Ryan I mentioned that I could see areas of code that were repetitious. He encouraged me to move forward and create a function for those areas. I created two functions. Upon further review, Ryan challenged me to look at the functions and see if I could create a single function that could do the work of both using a range of numbers.
* Enjoyed a fantastic Friday lunch with Ben visiting Sparkbox for the first time. 
* Created a toppings-hash branch for hotdo_adventure.rb and pushed it up to github
* Updated hotdog_adventure.rb by creating one function that replaced the work of two
