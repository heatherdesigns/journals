:sparkles: Welcome to Heather's Journal of Sparkbox Adventures!
===============================================================

Follow along as I share my weekly journals filled with daily tasks. I love lists. Lists help keep me organized and focused. Intermingled with my daily task lists, you will find items I feel important to reference and review, book reviews and the occassional anecdote or two. Happy reading!!
