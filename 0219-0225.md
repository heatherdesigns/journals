February 19 - 25, 2017
======================

Monday:
-------
February 20
* Read The Passionate Programmer.
* Created a markdown file of my week 5 journal and added it to Github. 
* Code School Ruby Bits, finished Level 1 on expressions & Level 2 on methods and classes.
* Began caffeine.rb, a program to practice objects and classes, then added it to Github.

Tuesday:

February 21
* Read The Passionate Programmer.
* Watched Treehouse Introduction to Patterns workshop. Iâ€™m loving https://sourcemaking.com. My first impression is that it presents information in an approachable, user-friendly way.
* Finished Level 3 on classes in Code School Ruby Bits and began Level 4 on activesupport. The next two levels of Ruby Bits are modules and blocks. I feel like Treehouse does a better job at introducing new topics in a simplistic way that is easier for me to grasp. I prefer to follow up with Code School for review and reinforcement. I like using both resources as they each present different ways of accomplishing the same task. For example, in Treehouse an instance variable begins with @variable, whereas  in Code School an instance variable begins with self.variable.

* Code Talk â†’ Patrick & Daniel did a fantastic job of explaining data structures. Iâ€™m excited for our conversation to continue next week. Daniel challenged me to think about adding a coffee shop class that implements a queue to my caffeinated beverage program.
* Paired with Cat to discuss my apprenticeship workflow and to see if she had any recommendations for me. Cat and Nate shared with me how they prepared for their first formal review and offered awesome words of encouragement!  
* Worked on caffeinated beverage program. The beverage_driver.rb file was throwing an undefined method â€˜add_espressoâ€™ for nil:NilClass (NoMethodError). I investigated Stack Overflow and read through the use of methods in classes on TutorialsPoint, each without success. Oddly enough, the line of code that was giving me errors in my beverage_driver.rb file worked perfectly fine in the coffee.rb file where the method was declared. After some experimentation and a few â€˜what if I did thisâ€™ scenarios, I discovered that when I initialized a new Coffee object, I added .to_s to the send of it so that it would automatically print to the console after it was created. Once I removed the .to_s from the newly created Coffee object, the .add_espresso method worked! ðŸŽ‰
* Iâ€™m trying to find a nice balance of my time that allows me to work on code and continue to build my knowledge base daily. 
* Read up on queue data structures, see Review / Reference for links.
* Reviewed git with Betty.

Thursday:
---------
February 23
* Merged add-espresso branch into master for my caffeinated-classes-objects repo. I need to do this for all the repos Iâ€™ve created since starting Ruby. I ran into an issue with a .metadata directory in my hello-friend repo. I need to investigate how to create a .gitignore file. --done! - Cat helped me. Going back and working on merging the branches in my repos has been a good experience this morning. I forgot that after pairing with Yock, I had renamed helloFriend.rb to hello_freind.rb. I ran out of time today, so I made myself a note to go back and resolve the issue.
* Paired with Yock to review progress on caffeinated-classes-objects. Yay!!! 
* 11 am - testing of the girlscancode.io site.
* Leave at noon to go see Jacob!

Friday:
-------
February 24
* Jacob graduates from NNPTC A-School! âš“

Saturday:
---------
February 25
* Volunteer with Girls Can Code Day! ðŸ’š
* Hermes Awards Show - Mardi Gras Party

Looking forward

Follow - up:
------------
* Work on coffee_shop.rb ~ add snarky responses to customer orders according to how much caffeine is in their drink. See comments in code re: Yockâ€™s ideaâ€™s.
* Hello_friend.rb â†’ Create interview class. Each time someone takes the interview, a new instance representing each person is created.
* Go back to hello_friend.rb, hello_functions.rb & hello_test.rb and comment out the code explaining what we did.
