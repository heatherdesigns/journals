March 5 - 11, 2017
==================

Monday:
-------
March 6
* Finished reading The Passionate Programmer. 🏁 
* Created a markdown file of my week 7 journal and added it to Github. (woah!!! It’s been 7 weeks already! 😺)
* Created README file for Betty & Heather’s Kata Adventure Extravaganza. Pushed to Github and created a pull request for Betty to review.
* Treehouse → Finished Ruby Blocks course. Next: Build an Address Book in Ruby.
* Updated caffeinated_beverage.rb so that the amount of caffeine is derived from the type of beverage. Updated coffee_shop.rb to reflect changes. Began working on a customer_order class.
* Met with Ryan to establish a game plan for the week.

Tuesday:
--------
March 7

![whys]

* Began reading Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby. 👆That is slightly disturbing. 😂 
* Paired with Yock for a review of dependency injection using a grocery store shopping looking to buy carrots. 
* Solved triangle kata using classes + pushed to Betty & Heather’s Ruby Kata Adventure. But it still feels like I’m missing something. I’m going to step away and do something else for a bit.
* Treehouse: Build An Address Book in Ruby. Earned class design badge.
* Watched Get a Whiff of This by Sandi Metz recommended by Yock. RailsConf 2016 - Get a Whiff of This by Sandi Metz: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJjHfa5yxlU I love this quote from Sandi: “Be brave about your ugly and embarrassing code.”

Wednesday:
----------
March 8
* Continue reading Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby. I wish I had started this book earlier, possibly a couple weeks ago. It is extremely entertaining and descriptive. Although the book is currently taking me through Ruby concepts I am already familiar with, it’s refreshing to revisit those concepts through the author’s eyes. This is the type of book I could easily get sucked into. I’m pretty sure I will be sitting on the couch cuddled up with my newly adopted puppy finishing this book this weekend. 
* Code Talk on Ruby TDD with Rob & Mike. https://github.com/bettybettybaker/tdd-question-exercise
* Dayton Clean Coders lightning talks. Excellent presentations given by Ryan, Jay, Taylor, Rob & Philip. I’m looking forward to Philip continuing his presentation next week at Gem City JS.
* Moment of confession: Last week I created a game plan to complete Treehouse’s Ruby track by the end of the day on Wednesday. That would be today. 😐 I realized yesterday that I wasn’t going to be able to fulfill my game plan. There’s several things in Ruby that I want to complete before moving onto JavaScript. Treehouse, Code School RubyBits, Ruby Koans, the caffeinate program, katas, follow up reading on data structures and design patterns, TDD …………. It can be a bit overwhelming. Sometimes it feels like my brain isn’t soaking all the things quick enough. 😔
Then we had code talk with Yock and Rob on TDD. The first time we discussed TDD my brain hurt. This time it made much more sense. So, the point being, I am learning. Even when it seems like I’m not accomplishing all the things as quickly as I want, I’m still moving forward. Don’t stress about the game plan and continue to focus on one task at a time to keep moving forward.
* Finished Treehouse: Build an Address Book in Ruby and earned the search badge. The next steps in this program covered input and output. I’m excited to finish this section and to get back into my caffeinated beverage program.    
* I just realized that I spent a significant amount of time writing code for the caffeinated beverages program on Monday, wrote a second version of the triangle kata on Tuesday and just finished Building an Address Book. And it’s only Wednesday. I still have two more days this week to do awesome things. Onward!! 🏇

Thursday:
---------
March 9
* Continue reading Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby. It’s always amazing to find new bits of information not covered by other resources. Today was .strip. I’ve used .chomp, but I didn’t know about .strip.   
* Worked with Betty to try to resolve a minitest issue. Found this: http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/short-introduction-minitest Later in the day I googled Ruby minitest and found several other resources.
* Worked in version 2 of the triangle kata. I knew that I wanted to create a class that would allow a user to enter 3 lengths that could be used to determine what kind of triangle those lengths create. A couple hours later… I successfully created my first test class! I’m still in shock at the moment. First test & it worked, not the first time I tried to run it, but I wrote it unassisted and eventually it worked. #winning (Side note: Yock helped me write a test class a few weeks ago, but it isn’t the same as when you write it all by yourself. 😆)
* Cleaned up triangle version 2 kata by moving all classes into their own separate files.
* Complete Code School Ruby Bits Level 4 on ActiveSupport. Level 5 is on Modules, which just happens to be the next course covered in the Treehouse track.

Friday:
-------
March 10
* Coffee Hour with Ben & Rob. ☕
* Treehouse Modules course. Earned Ruby modules basics, core modules and include + extends badges. Began to create a store inventory program using modules.
* Worked on triangle version 2.
* Pair with Betty &/or Patrick this afternoon. Patrick has office hours, but he’s also cooking this morning. If he is unavailable this afternoon, I’ll see about pairing early next week.

Over the weekend:
-----------------
* Ruby Koans

Looking forward
===============

Follow - up:
------------
* Sign up to make + take food to families with new babies!
* Caffeinated beverages program → TDD for customer class.
* Fix array in coffee_shop.rb. Add snarky responses to customer orders according to how much caffeine is in their drink. Think about implementing option for hot and cold drinks. Add customer name and time order was taken to the class. Time.now
* Look for opportunities to practice TDD & creating data structures.
* Go back to Triangle Kata & ‘raise an error’ (review resources then do): https://github.com/sparkbox/apprenticeships/blob/overhaul/basic-programming/project-triangle-kata.md
* Check out the testing triangle by Michael Cohan.
* Roman Numerals Kata. There’s an english number kata in my GDI Ruby files.
* Ruby Katas: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1puCJys3ZRYnEDG5BzOD1WuoFk9WbWN3zQRvkN2XJEMI/edit#heading=h.8szhesuord3m
* Learn Ruby the Hard Way continue: https://learnrubythehardway.org/book/ex43.html
* Treehouse → Working to finish the Ruby track (minus the last course of Building Web Apps with Sinatra) 
* Code School’s Ruby Bits
* Ruby Koans → here’s a great blog to help understand: http://ploos.io/ruby-koans-companion-part-1-about_asserts-rb/
* Check out Ruby Warrior: https://www.bloc.io/ruby-warrior#/ It looks like fun!!
* Check this out: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history
