March 12 - 18, 2017
===================

Monday:
-------
March 13
* Created a markdown file of my week 8 journal and added it to Github. 
* Added Girls Can Code pictures to Dropbox.
* Met with Ryan to establish game plan for the week. It’s time for JavaScript!! Yay!!! 
* Worked on triangle kata revisions. △
* Paired with Patrick. We worked on creating a passing test for the equilateral class. I was able to apply that I learned to creating tests for the isosceles, scalene and right angle classes.
* Start JavaScript course in Treehouse.

Tuesday:
--------
March 14
* It’s π day! I’ve been told it’s the third best Sparkbox holiday. It should be a pretty fantastic day!
* Continued reading Why’s Poignant Guide to Ruby. 
* Paired with Yock for a review of my triangle kata. He made some recommendations that I was able to implement and gave me food for thought on my next steps regarding using user input to create a triangle.
* Finish Ruby Modules course in Treehouse
* Paired with Betty to review our triangle kata’s. It’s pretty cool to see how we both decided to solve this kata from different angles. A couple ‘I didn’t think of that.’ moments which led to me go back and make my code even better.
* Pushed triangle kata to my Ruby Katas repository. Future updates will be posted in this repository now. 
* Created a repository to hold JavaScript tutorials completed from Treehouse.
* Began and finished JavaScript Code School Road Trip Part 1. 

Wednesday:
----------
March 15
* Paired with Nate to problem solve an issue I had accessing a method in my triangle kata and had a major breakthrough!!!! Woo hoo!! It works! Praise Jesus! (Seriously I was up until 11:30 scouring through stack overflow, former apprentices’ Ruby projects and my Treehouse projects trying to find a resolution.) 😹💃💥
* Gem City JS Lightning Talks
* Code School JavaScript Road Trip Part 2. The ‘incorrect submission’ messages in Code School’s JavaScript  tutorial really stink! “Attempted to assign readonly property.” is the default error message. 
* Finished Code School JavaScript Road Trip Road 2, Levels 1 & 2.

Thursday:
---------
March 16
* Ruby Koans → I 💛 how these are finally starting to click. The koans have helped me learn how to navigate around Ruby docs to find the answers I need. The completed koans will also serve as an excellent resource for testing. Good stuff! 70 of 282 completed.
* Review HTML/CSS GDI slides (classes 1 & 2) for this weekend! http://catheraaine.com/intro/links.html
* Read the latest foundry post by Patrick: https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/the_value_of_local_meetups Meetups are one of the main reasons for where I am today. Connecting into our local web community has been extremely valuable for me.
* Finished Code School JavaScript Road Trip Part 2. 🚗

Friday:
-------
March 17
* Continue working on caffeinated beverage program. Added a Size class and made changes to CustomerOrder class.
* JavaScript Code Talk with Nate & Rob.
* Finished Code School JavaScript Road Trip Part 3, Level 1. What kind of insanity is this? 😂 I quote “What is obtained when the result of passing 9 into the fourth function of the puzzlers array is then passed into the function whose array index matches the result of passing 3 into the second function of the puzzlers array?” hahaha!!! On a positive note, I solved it without revealing the answer. I think my brain is done for the day.

Saturday:
---------
March 18
* TA GDI HTML/CSS workshop.


Looking forward
