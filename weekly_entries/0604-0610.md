June 4 - 10
===========

Monday:
-------
June 5
* I successfully rebased two branches today without creating a hot mess. Dare I say I’m making improvement?
* Continued to work on adding classes to handlebar files and styling of the place card.
* Created a postinstall task for our project. Paired with Adam and Tarr.

Tuesday:
--------
June 6
* Paired with Betty.
* Created a markdown file of my week 20 journal and added it to Github.
* Continued to work on styling of the place card.
* When you need a quick review / lesson on file paths: https://css-tricks.com/quick-reminder-about-file-paths/ I love css-tricks!

Wednesday:
----------
June 7
* Sent Ethan request to review PR for styling the place card.
* Checked out: http://assemble.io/docs/YAML-front-matter.html
* I thought about using Foundation 6 block grid for our project. I played with it in Code Pen first. https://codepen.io/heatherdesigns/pen/LLpEee
I really like block grid, but….. At this point in the project, I don’t think it’s a wise idea to implement something that may require another learning curve. Maybe it would be a good thing to do on a personal project. I chose to use flexbox because it is something that Betty and I have both worked with in the event cards we created a couple months (or was weeks?) ago.
* Received feedback from Ethan on the place card and implemented his suggestions.
* Checked out .getkeep

* Looked at a npm module for making a directory: https://www.npmjs.com/package/mkdirp
* Wednesday = two steps forward, one step back. Keep moving…..

Thursday:
---------
June 8
* Had a quick pairing session with Ryan regarding an issue with failing Heroku builds. Yay for setting NODE_MODULES_CACHE=false!!!! https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/nodejs-support#cache-behavior All the things work again.
* Made a grid for the place cards. Yay!!!!!

Friday:
-------
June 9
* Paired with Betty. Merged her work on the Sparkeats header. She in turn merged my work on the grid.
* Paired with Catherine to add font resources to our project.
* Paired with Betty & Rob to discuss data handling in our project.
* Working to implement the background element for the place card header. If there is an image, use the image. If not, use the pattern. The image must be pulled through data, which is accessed for each individual place through HTML. Considered using inline-styles? (I later scratched that thought and came up with a better solution.) Looked at https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/b/background/

Saturday:
---------
June 3
* TA'd at an excellent GDI Intermediate HTML + CSS workshop. So much fantastic information was shared in a short time.
