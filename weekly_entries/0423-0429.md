April 23 - 29, 2017
===================

Monday:
-------
April 24
* Created a markdown file of my week 14 journal and added it to Github.
* Read Mobile First (only one chapter to go!!)
* Created another event card
* Read: https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/
* Read Foundry post “Let’s Write Beautiful CSS Comments” by Ethan Muller
  * “A good magician never reveals his or her secrets, but a good developer always does.” - Nice!!!!
  * Beautiful comments say why (not what). It’s more useful to state what code is intending to accomplish rather than what exactly it’s doing.
* Treehouse workshops: finished Practice CSS Floats and began Responsive Layouts.
* Earned Responsive Theory & Media Queries badges.
* Created a pen in CodePen to play with floats.
* Learned that I’m an honoree for an AAF-Dayton Mercury Award in the Unsung Hero category. Shocked and yet I’m pretty sure that I know who nominated me. I’m humbled and grateful.
