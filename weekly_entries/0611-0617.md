June 11 - 17, 2017
==================

Monday:
-------
June 12
* Stand up with Betty & Drew
* Coffee Hour with Ben & Rob
* Added week 21 to Github Journal
* Fixed image links not showing in Heroku. I had removed a scss partial that was created for normalize.css. Since we haven‚Äôt implemented normalize, I removed the partial. But‚Ä¶.. I forgot to remove the @import ‚Äúnormalize‚Äù statement from the base scss partial. Once I removed the @import, everything works as expected in Heroku. üòÄ
* Wrote update for Ryan in apprentice channel:
  * Here‚Äôs a quick review of this morning‚Äôs standup:
    * I paired with Catherine on Friday morning to learn how to add fonts to our project. The primary font is Avenir Next, which is a Sparkbox font. We used the @font-face rule to download Avenir Next. We used typography.com for the secondary font, Whitney. I created a card on our board to remind us to go to typography.com and update our project‚Äôs status from development to production prior to launch.
    * Friday afternoon Betty & I paired with Tarr to look at how seesparkbox.com uses data.
    * We have a grid for our project. I am in the process of refactoring it this afternoon.
    * In setting up the project grid, I did not worry about the header images in the place cards. I focused on creating the grid. The header image was simply a background url set to the Sparkeats pattern. Once I had a grid in place, I created a new branch to work on adding images pulled from data for each place card.
    * We are also working on testing our project across various browsers and devices to see how it looks at this point.
* UXDayton meetup. Carrie Nickels presented ‚ÄòLearn how to use Canva‚Äô. Fun and easily addictive.
