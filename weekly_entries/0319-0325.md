===================

Monday:  
-------
March 20
* Created a markdown file of my week 9 journal and added it to Github.
* Completed Ruby Koans on symbols and regular expressions.
* Reviewed slides from Code School Road Trip Part 2.
* Wrote triangle kata in JS & pushed to Github.
* Continued learning JS via Treehouse. Treehouse has a very different approach teaching JavaScript than CodeSchool. I’m enjoying the variation.
* Earned the Introducing JavaScript badge in Treehouse.
Started Roman Numerals kata.

Tuesday:

* Worked on Roman Numerals JS kata. I feel like I’m running around in circles trying to wrap my head around how to solve this. If anything, I’ve been doing a lot of reading and research. I found this solution which seems to make the most sense using syntax that I am familiar with: http://www.selftaughtjs.com/algorithm-sundays-converting-roman-numerals/ Part of me is bummed that I didn’t come up with a solution quickly, another part of me thinks, hey you found a sweet tutorial with the answer! When you don’t know how to do something, you look to the Googles for help. I get an A+ on the Googles today! 🙈🙉🙊
* Visited and talked about the apprenticeship with Aaron, a high school senior who was job shadowing at Sparkbox for the day.
* I’m frustrated with my brain today. I feel like the sector that computes logic is full of fuzz. 😯 I recall feeling this way a couple weeks ago. It was also a Tuesday. Maybe it’s a Tuesday thing. Hhhhmmm…..
* Continued learning JS in Treehouse. Did you know that you can speed up how fast the video plays in Treehouse? It’s hilarious!!! And yet extremely useful. Earned the Storing and Tracking Information with Variables badge.

Wednesday:

March 22
* Code review focused on Triangle JS & Ruby katas.
In my Ruby Triangle kata, I created a new class called asks_triangle_lengths to replace the user_triangle class. Added validation to the lengths input by the user. If the lengths do not create a triangle, the user is asked to re-enter the lengths. And refactored code.
* Installed Atom.
* Worked on changes to my JS Triangle kata as discussed at our morning code review.
* Stayed up too late to begin the implementation of a new solution for Roman Numerals kata. 😴 Maybe if I went to bed at 8:30 pm I would avoid the second wind of energy that always seems to set in around 9 pm. Haha!!! Oh well! I’m happy with my progress today.  

Thursday:

March 23
* Created test cases for each function in Triangle.js. Paired with Nathan to resolve an issue with a variable that I set as global, but should have been set as local.
* Lots of codes this morning. Triangle.js has evolved and my brain is still thinking of ways to make it better.
* Continued writing my version of the roman numerals kata. Yay! Winner winner chicken dinner!!! 🐔🐔🐔 I created my very own version of the roman numerals kata and it works!!!! Whoop whoop!! You know the song “Happy” by Pharrell Williams? That’s my theme song for today.
* Completed Treehouse’s Ruby Enumerable workshop and earned the Ruby Core badge.

Friday:

March 24
* Reviewed Atom welcome guide. Explored linting tools and installed linter. I wonder if there’s an Atom keyboard shortcuts cheat sheet. → Found it! 🎯
I need to memorize cmd-shift-p. This shall be my new friend.
* Explored CodePen Projects.
* Learn more JS using Treehouse. And…. Treehouse went down at 11:57. Lunch time!!!!
* Continued learning JS in Treehouse. Earned Working with Numbers badge.
* Put Roman Numerals kata in CodePen and evolved it into a calculator that takes a number and returns the roman numeral. I’m so excited!!! https://codepen.io/heatherdesigns/project/editor/XjLbaD/ Now I need to make it look pretty! 💅
* Reviewed GDI HTML/CSS slides for Saturday’s class.
