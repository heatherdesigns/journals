May 10
* 1st Apprenticeship project stand-up!
* Met with Betty. We tackled setting up our package.json file and our â€˜hello world!â€™ start task.
* Betty & I paired with Catherine to review the progress we made on our project.
* Looked at seesparkbox.com repo and look for things to look up and read about. What is NODE_ENV? What is â€˜shelljsâ€™, â€˜pathâ€™, â€˜globbyâ€™, â€˜informâ€™, etc? What do they do? What do we really need for our project?  npm install all the things!!!! (only if we need them. ha!)
* Looked up Handlebars. Iâ€™ve heard of it, now what is it? http://handlebarsjs.com/
* Found and scanned through documentation for Browsersync: https://www.browsersync.io/
* Paired with Daniel and Lindsay for a lesson on using NODE_ENV

Friday:

May 11
* Stand-up no. 2
* Paired with Betty and successfully set up a task that compiles Sass to CSS within our project. We have decided to divide conquer for a bit. I am going to work on the next step of Sass to CSS compiling which takes the NODE_ENV into consideration. Betty will begin on the next project card that requires us to build html files from templates and data.
* Using a practice project, I took the next step in compiling Sass to CSS. I created a second start script in the package.json file for a production environment which sets NODE_ENV to production, then runs the build. Now I need to implement the strategy into our project.
Reviewed a reference document I created months ago when learning git.
